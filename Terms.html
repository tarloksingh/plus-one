Plus One is owned and developed by Openup Technologies Inc. (“Company,” “we” or “us”). For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Services.
            
            We also have a Privacy Policy that discusses what information we collect and how we use this information. You should read the Privacy Policy because it governs the Company’s use of your personal information.
            
            IMPORTANT NOTE: THE SECTION TITLED “ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW” CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS-ACTION WAIVER THAT APPLIES TO ALL U.S.-BASED Plus One USERS.

        <p>You represent that you are at least 17 years of age and possess the legal capacity to enter into the agreement set forth in these Terms. No one under the age of 17 is allowed to use or access Plus One. If you are old enough to use or access Plus One but are not old enough to have authority to consent to our terms, your parent or guardian must agree to these Terms on your behalf. If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your teenager to use the services, then these Terms also apply to you and you’re responsible for your teenager’s activity on the services.

        <h2>Accounts and Software Updates</h2>
        <p>When you create your Plus One account, you agree that the information you submit is correct and complete.

You can delete your Plus One account by tapping  Profile › Delete Account.

            Using Plus One requires that we initially download software to your computer, phone, tablet, or other device. You agree that we may automatically update that software, and that these Terms and our policies will apply to any updates.
             </p>
        <h2>Your license to use Plus One</h2>
        <p>The Services, including their “look and feel” (e.g., text, graphics, images, logos), proprietary content, information, and other materials, and the proprietary software and other technology used to provide the Services are protected under copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You agree that the Company and/or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to the Services (including any and all intellectual property rights therein), and you agree not to take any action(s) inconsistent with such ownership interests. Although we are granting you this license, we and our licensors retain all intellectual property rights we have in our software and Services (other than User Content (defined below)), including, without limitation, the exclusive right to create derivative works.

            The Plus One name and the Plus One logo or icon (the “hills” design) and all related names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans are trademarks of the Company or its affiliates or licensors.

            Some of our Services allow you to download client software. So long as you comply with these Terms, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, personal, non-assignable, and revocable license to download, install, and run that software, solely to access our Services.
            
            You may not copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, sell, lease, or sublicense any of our software or Services.

            While your User Content belongs to you, several important limitations apply:

            First, User Content does not include your Plus One username. Should you or Plus One terminate your account, you do not retain any rights in the username you used. A new Plus One user may use the username in the future.

            Second, you grant Plus One and our users a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, store, display, reproduce, save, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute your User Content for the purposes of using, accessing, operating, developing, and providing Plus One. Nothing in these Terms restricts other legal rights Plus One may have to User Content, for example under other licenses.

            Third, we retain the right to remove or modify User Content or change the way it’s used in Plus One, for any reason. This includes User Content that, in our judgment, violates these Terms or any other policies.

            Fourth, content you share with others on Plus One may continue to exist on Plus One even if you leave Plus One. We may back up, archive, and retain your User Content even if you terminate or deactivate your account or delete or remove specific User Content. Plus One and its users may retain and continue to use, store, display, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute any of your User Content that other users have stored or shared on Plus One.

            Subscriptions

        </h2>
        <h2>
            Automatic Renewal and Cancellation

        </h2>
        <p>
            Plus One currently does not offer any subscription models but may soon in the future. If you subscribe, your subscription will automatically renew until you cancel, and you will be charged the associated fee (plus any applicable taxes) until you cancel. To view your next renewal date and current fee, access your mobile device’s account settings or the Subscriptions tab available through the Apple App Store.

You must cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the end of your current billing period to avoid being charged for the next billing period. After cancellation, you will maintain access to your subscription until the last day of your current billing period, after which your subscription (along with its features) will cease.

You have the option to cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple App Store. To regain access to subscription features after discontinuing your paid subscription, you may need to purchase a new subscription, subject to prevailing fees, terms, and conditions.

        </p>
        <h2>
            Paying For Your Subscription
        </h2>
        <p>Payments for your subscription are processed via Apple ("App Provider"), and you will be required to provide your payment information to the App Provider. It is your responsibility to maintain accurate and up-to-date payment information. If a payment fails, we may suspend your access to the relevant subscription features until you provide a valid payment method. Plus One is not liable if your subscription fails to renew due to invalid payment information.</p>
        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>Requests for refunds are managed by your App Provider, not Plus One. To seek a refund, you should adhere to your App Provider’s refund procedures. Plus One does not grant refunds for your subscription. If you cancel, we will not issue a refund or credit for any partial-period access to your subscription. You are not entitled to a refund or credit for any portion of a billing period in cases where the Subscription Features are unavailable, defective, delayed, or for any other reason.</p>
        <h2>Changes to Subscriptions and Features
        </h2>
        <p>We retain the right to modify or discontinue your subscription plans, subscription features, terms, or pricing at any time. Plus One is not liable for any damage or loss arising from failures or delays related to your subscription or the subscription features.</p>
        <h2>SMS messages</h2>
        <p>Plus One will send you SMS or short message service messages, commonly known as text messages, for two-factor authentication. Please note that message and data rates may apply.</p>
        <h2>Help</h2>

You are also responsible for any carrier services required to send text messages and for paying any service fees associated with such access.

            ALL TEXT MESSAGE COMMUNICATIONS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES WILL BE SUBJECT TO YOUR CARRIER’S TEXT MESSAGING RATES. ANY INQUIRIES, SUPPORT, PRICING, BILLING, OR REFUND RELATED TO TEXT MESSAGES MUST BE DIRECTED TO YOUR CARRIER'S CUSTOMER SUPPORT TEAM.

            Plus One retains the right to modify, suspend, limit the use of, discontinue, or permanently cancel all or a portion of the SMS Services at any time. While Plus One makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the Services are available, there may be times when the Services are interrupted for maintenance, upgrades, emergency repairs, or due to telecommunications link and equipment failures beyond our control. By using the Services, you agree that Plus One will not be held liable for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services.
            </p>
        <h2>When you provide us with your phone number
        </h2>
        <p>To utilize the Services, you must engage in an opt-in process by furnishing us with your phone number (referred to as your "Phone Number") through the Site ("Opt-in"). Following the Opt-in, an invitation will be dispatched to your Phone Number via an SMS message, encouraging you to register for an Account. Additionally, if you are not already registered for our Services, other Users may dispatch an SMS message through the App to invite you.

            You have the ability to block messages from Plus One and other communications related to our Services at any time by texting 'STOP' to the number that sent you the text. If you decide to use the Services and register for an Account subsequent to unsubscribing, you will need to complete the Opt-in process once again. We will subsequently send you an invite via SMS message to register.
            
            In case you forget the supported keywords, you can text "HELP" to the number that messaged you, and we will provide you with instructions on how to utilize the Service and how to unsubscribe. Our capacity to deliver SMS messages extends to the mobile phone carriers listed above.
            
            You understand, acknowledge, and agree that: 
            - Text message and data rates may be applicable for any SMS messages sent to you from us, or between you and other Users.
            - You are solely responsible for any fees imposed by your wireless provider in relation to SMS messages that you send or receive as part of the Opt-in and/or the Services.
            - You will address inquiries concerning your text and/or data plan directly with your wireless provider.
            
            Once you receive an invite via SMS message, and if you decide to continue using the Services, you will be required to create an account through the App. This involves providing certain information, such as your name, gender, phone number, contact book, and photo. By registering for an account, you agree to:
            - Furnish accurate, current, and complete information about yourself.
            - Regularly update your account information to maintain its accuracy, currency, and completeness.
            
            In case you provide information that is false, inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect such inaccuracies, we hold the right to suspend or terminate your Account and to deny you any present or future use of the Services.
            </p>

        <h2>Our Liability is Limited</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Plus One, its parent company Openup Technologies Inc., and its owners, officers, directors, employees, or agents will not be liable under any legal theory or in equity for any incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, punitive, or other damages, or for any interruption of business or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from the use of or inability to use our Service or its content. This includes any conduct or content of any third party on the Service, including, but not limited to, any defamatory, offensive, or illegal content or conduct of other users or third parties; unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content; and any claims arising from errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the Service or the content. Regardless of the cause, even if Plus One has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Any liability for claims against the company, its affiliates, or any of their owners, officers, directors, employees, or agents is limited to $100.00 or the smallest amount permissible by law, whichever is lesser.

            If you are dissatisfied with the Service, the content, or these Terms, your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease using the Service.
            
            If we cause damage to you and you are a consumer in the European Economic Area (EEA), the above provision does not apply. Instead, Plus One's liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. Plus One is not liable for damages resulting from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability does not apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct, or liability excluded in cases where we have specifically promised something to you in writing.
            
            This limitation of liability provision remains in effect despite any cancellation, termination, or suspension of your Plus One account and the termination of these Terms.

        <h2>Arbitration and Governing Law</h2>
        <p>If a dispute arises with Plus One, please contact us. We will work to address it with you quickly and informally.

            Should an informal resolution of the dispute prove impossible, you agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to your access or use of Plus One or these Terms, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this provision, shall be determined by final, binding, and non-appealable arbitration.
            
            Arbitration is a less expensive and often quicker means for parties to resolve disputes than filing a lawsuit in a court of law. An independent and neutral arbitrator decides the case, not a judge or jury. The arbitration award is final and not subject to review by a court. Arbitrators, however, can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
            
            By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision and Agreement, and that you and Plus One are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and the termination of your Plus One account. Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. You can find their forms at www.adr.org.
            
            Unless you and Plus One agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the City and County of Austin or Travis County, California. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules, except that Plus One will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
            
            If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
            
            Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Service.
            
            ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Plus One ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
            
            NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.
            
            To the extent any claim, dispute, or controversy regarding Plus One or our Service isn't arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and Plus One both agree that any claim or dispute regarding Plus One will be resolved exclusively in a Texas court governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. If you are not a consumer in the EEA, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with these Terms is Travis County, Texas, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and our dispute will be determined under California law.
            
            If you're a consumer in the EEA, this arbitration provision does not apply to you.
            </p>
        <h2>Opt-Out
        </h2>
        <p>You have the option to decline the agreement to arbitrate by emailing an opt-out notice to help@plus-one.com within 30 days of August 25, 2023, or within 30 days of when you first register your Plus One account, whichever is later. If you choose to opt out of these arbitration provisions, you will not be bound by them. Similarly, Plus One  will not be bound by the arbitration provisions if you opt out.</p>

You must adhere to any applicable third-party terms of agreement while using the Plus One app. You and the Company acknowledge and agree that Apple, along with its subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms concerning your use of the Plus One app. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple gains the right to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary.
